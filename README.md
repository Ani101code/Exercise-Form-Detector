# Exercise-Form-Detector

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue)

The aim of this project is to develop an AI-powered exercise form analysis system that uses computer vision to analyze human movement in real time, provide feedback on exercise technique, and count exercise repetitions automatically.

The system detects body posture from live video input and evaluates joint positions and movement patterns to identify incorrect form, asymmetries, and unsafe movements. In addition, it tracks movement cycles to accurately count repetitions (reps), helping users monitor training volume while reducing injury risk and improving exercise efficiency.
