1) Technical references (pose estimation, CV pipelines, implementation stack), and
2) Anatomical / biomechanics references (exercise technique, joint angles, muscle activation, EMG) for push-ups, pull-ups/chin-ups, and squats.

Notes for use in this project

- Technical thresholds (e.g., elbow/knee/hip angle cutoffs) should be treated as heuristic ranges informed by literature and coaching guidelines, then calibrated empirically for camera setup and user population.
- EMG findings are exercise-variation dependent (grip width, cadence, tempo, load, depth, fatigue), so references are best used to justify rule directionality (what tends to increase/decrease activation), not as absolute universal cutoffs.
